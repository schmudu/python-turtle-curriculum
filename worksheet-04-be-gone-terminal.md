# Lesson 4 - Be Gone Terminal!
One of the annoying things is typing things over and over......and over.  Let's figure out an easier way.

## Section 1 - Start Python Terminal
Follow the directions from the previous lesson and start the Python command prompt.

## Section 2 - Create python file
1. Open a text editor and add the following content:
```python
import turtle
def turn
turtle.reset()
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.right(90)
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.right(90)
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.right(90)
turtle.forward(100)
```
Save as `first-python-file.py` and close the file.

2. In the terminal run the command `python3 my-file.py` and press <Enter>.  What happens?

3. What's easier?  Typing all of the commands over and over or just entering the commands in the file once and executing the file?

From now on we will be editing `my-file.py` and executing the commands so we don't have to do it over and over.

## Section 4 - Mastery Checkup
- What does the `python3 my-file.py` do?
- What happens if we run the command `python3 mia.py` or `python3 kaili.py`?
