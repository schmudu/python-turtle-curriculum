# Lesson 2 - It's Just a Box - Variables
We are going to learn about variables and the print command.

## Section 1 - Start Python Terminal
Follow the directions from the previous lesson and start the Python command prompt.

## Section 3 - Let store something
1. One of the important things in coding is the idea of variables which is just a fancy way of saying how to store stuff.

Let's try storing stuff in variables.
```python
my_color = 'blue'

for i in range(4):
    turtle.color(my_color)
    turtle.forward(75)
    turtle.right(90)
```

What color is the square above?

2. How would you change the color of the square?

3. The variable `my_color` is just a variable.  Change the name of the `my_color` variable to `this_is_my_favorite_color` and see what happens.

3. Another important command is the `print` command.  Modify the code to the following:
```python
my_color = 'purple'

print(f'my color is {my_color}')
for i in range(4):
    turtle.color(my_color)
    turtle.forward(75)
    turtle.right(90)
```
What does the command `print` do?

## Section 3 - Exit the Terminal
1. Enter the following command: `exit()` and press `Enter`.

## Section 4 - Mastery Checkup
- What does the `print` command do?
- What can you name your variables?
